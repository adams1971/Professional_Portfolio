# 16 Project 2: Professional Materials

This is the 3rd iteration of my Portfolio website. I am adding more projects that reflect some of skills I have learned during the second 3rd of my FSF bootcamp.
Having built a full-stack web application and having more progress to share, this site will demonstrate some of those technoligies and skills.
