                      <p>I am a frontend web developer with a rich background in
                        hospitality management and team-building. Throughout my career as an Executive Chef
                        the focus has been to provide guests with the best possible experience
                        while positioning my organization in the community sight-lines.
                        </p>

                        As a young cook, I was curious about the how gastronomy started, how were all these foods created? It wasn't enough to accept that food was just a necessity- there had to a reason. Along my journey, one major focus of my career has been in the creation of cured meats. From an early start, I found my self wanting to know what made them what they are? It was a long journey and learning the techniques was not easy! Making a great prosciutto or finocchiona is a detailed craft and takes commitment. This curiosity is what I bring to my new endeavor, a relentless pursuit to know why and how and of course to create!

                      <p>Now, moving into a new career, having discovered a new creative passion, the focus remains the same. Bring to the guest the best possible product. Soon, I will complete a full stack web development bootcamp from the University of Washington a Trilogy curriculum. Over the course of the program, I have developed many new skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node.js- which hasn't come easy and the journey continues!
                        With an emphasis on responsive web design there are several additional technologies that I have been exposed to with many more to come.
